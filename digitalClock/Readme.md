# Digital Clock

 In this project, I learned about some basics 

- querySelector - method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.
     we can also use document.getElementByID instead of querySelector()
- querySelectorAll( ) will return  all the elements that matches specified Css selector  
- setInterval() - method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). |
    here we are using only setInterval because we don't need to stop the clock rotation if we want to make it stop we can |
    use clearInterval() which will make the clock stop if we give a particular time in milliseconds.
