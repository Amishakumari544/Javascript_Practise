### Day -2 Quiz App in JavaScript 👀

### Learning 👋😼

- How to style your css in JavaScript 🥳
- how to make a simple quiz app 👻
- how to play and get value in radio button
- forEach loop - method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.
- used foreach for the answer to check and get its id to get the correct answer
- also faced problem 😱 after making function getting select id , it was selecting same radio button for the next question 
- for this we have make one function "deselect()" which will deselect after getting the current question answer from the radio button
- we just need to make the checked false 
- I have used "getElementById" and "getElementByName" we can also replace this with querySelector and querySelectorAll 😌
